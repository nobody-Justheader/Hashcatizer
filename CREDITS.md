## Inspiration

This project is directly inspired by the **`*2john` converter scripts** from the
[John the Ripper](https://github.com/openwall/john) project (bleeding-jumbo branch).

The original `*2john` scripts convert various encrypted file formats into John the Ripper's
hash format. **Hashcatizer** adapts these concepts for [hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/),
outputting hashes in hashcat-compatible format with appropriate mode numbers.

## Original Authors (openwall/john)

The following individuals authored the original JtR converter scripts that served as
reference implementations for Hashcatizer's extraction logic:

- **Dhiru Kholia** (`@kholia`) — `ssh2john.py`, `ethereum2john.py`, `bitcoin2john.py`,
  `ansible2john.py`, `bitwarden2john.py`, `bitlocker2john.py`, `keepass2john.py`,
  `encfs2john.py`, `truecrypt_volume2john.py`, and many others
- **magnumripper** — Core JtR development and hash format contributions
- **Fist0urs** — `office2john.py`, `pdf2john.py` contributions
- **philsmd** — hashcat format specifications and `itunes_backup2hashcat`
- **Chick3nman** — Ethereum hash format design
- **Gavin Andresen** — Original Bitcoin wallet parsing code

  advanced password recovery utility, created by **Jens "atom" Steube** and the hashcat team.
  Hashcatizer exists to complement hashcat by converting encrypted files into hashcat-ready
  hash format. All mode numbers, hash format specifications, and example hashes referenced in
  this project come from hashcat's excellent documentation. Without hashcat, this project would
  have no purpose. Thank you to the entire hashcat community for building and maintaining such
  an incredible tool.
